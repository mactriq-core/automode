## Metadata

{% callout %}
This feature is in development
{% /callout %}

Most updatable Automode Objects - including User, Company, Sales, Purchase, Order, Incoice and Bills - have a `metadata` parameter. You can use this parameter to attach arbitrary key-value data to these Automode objects.

You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long.

Metadata is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object.

Don't store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) in metadata.
