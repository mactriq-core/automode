Rating or scoring user stories is a crucial practice in agile development methodology to prioritize and plan work effectively. In this article, we will explore the process of rating user stories in agile projects, discuss the purpose of scoring, highlight different rating techniques, address frequently asked questions, and provide insights on selecting an ideal rating scale for developing a financial accounting application.

### How to understand User Story Rating ?

Rating or scoring user stories involves assigning a value or score to each user story based on its complexity, effort required, business value, and other relevant factors. The purpose of rating user stories is to prioritize work and estimate the effort needed for implementation accurately. By assigning ratings, agile teams can plan iterations, allocate resources, and focus on delivering the most valuable functionality to the end-users early in the development process.

##### What are the different rating techniques present ?

Several techniques can be used to rate user stories, including relative sizing, planning poker, t-shirt sizing, and numeric scales. Relative sizing compares the complexity of user stories against a reference story, while planning poker involves team members assigning a Fibonacci-based score to each story. T-shirt sizing uses small, medium, large, etc., to represent the size and complexity of a story. Numeric scales, such as 1-10, allow for more granular scoring based on effort or complexity. The choice of technique depends on team preference and the specific needs of the project.

#### FAQs

##### How do you determine the complexity of a user story?

Complexity can be determined by considering factors such as the number of steps involved, technical challenges, dependencies, and the level of effort required for implementation.

##### What is the purpose of assigning business value to user stories?

Assigning business value helps prioritize user stories based on their importance to stakeholders, aligning development efforts with strategic goals and customer needs.

##### Can the rating of a user story change during the project?

Yes, the rating of user stories can change as the team gains more clarity and understanding of the requirements. Ratings are not fixed and can be adjusted as needed.

##### How does rating user stories impact sprint planning?

Rating user stories aids in sprint planning by providing a clear indication of the effort and complexity associated with each story, allowing the team to allocate work effectively based on their capacity.

##### Ideal Rating Scale

For a financial accounting application, an ideal rating scale could be a numeric scale from 1 to 5, with 1 representing simple tasks, such as basic data entry, and 5 representing complex functionalities, such as generating financial statements or handling complex tax calculations.
