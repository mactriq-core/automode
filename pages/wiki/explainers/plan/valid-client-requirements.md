### What are valid Client Requirements ?

Valid client requirements in agile development refer to clear, specific, and achievable statements of what the client wants to achieve with the product or system being developed. These requirements form the foundation for project planning, implementation, and prioritization of work. In agile methodology, requirements are typically captured as user stories, which outline the desired functionality from an end-user perspective. Valid client requirements should be measurable, relevant, and aligned with the project's objectives and business goals. They should also be testable and independent of implementation details, allowing flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process.
